# About

This is a revival of the awesome software for pdf presentations called.... PDF Presenter. 
It was released in 2011, and the original `jar` still works and can be found [here](http://pdfpresenter.sourceforge.net), but the source code needed some love to compile again, at least outside the intended Eclipse compilation environment.

So here it is, PDF Presenter adapted for Apache Maven builds.
The `pom` file and underlying organization of the build should be clumsy at the moment, but I'll try to improve it a bit (it works).

I'm cooking some ideas on what features a presentation software should have and I'll try to implement those here... enjoy.

# Build

Requires Apache Maven.

`make build`


# Run

`pdfpresenter.jar` is already compiled on the repo.
